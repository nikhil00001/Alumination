## üìñ The Story Behind This Project

This project holds a special place as one of my early works. It was developed rapidly to meet an urgent need for my college club's first alumni fest. The goal was to create an engaging and informative landing page that would serve as the central hub for event details, schedules, and registration links.

As a foundational project, it's a testament to applying core web development skills to solve a real-world problem under a tight deadline. While my skills have grown significantly since then, this project showcases my ability to deliver a functional and visually appealing product using nothing but the fundamentals.

## ‚ú® Key Features Implemented

* **Interactive Landing Page:** A full-screen landing area with a video background and scroll-triggered animations.
* **Event Details Modals:** Clicking on an event opens a clean, blurred-background popup (modal) with a detailed description and a link to a Google Form for registration.
* **Vertical Event Timeline:** A two-day event schedule is displayed in a vertical timeline that animates into view as the user scrolls.
* **Pure CSS & JS Animations:** All animations, from the bouncing scroll arrow to the on-scroll reveal effects for the timeline, were implemented from scratch.
* **Fully Responsive Design:** Custom media queries were written to ensure the layout is functional and looks good across desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.

## üéì What I Learned

Building "Alumination" was a fantastic learning experience that solidified my grasp of essential web concepts:

* **Direct DOM Manipulation:** Writing JavaScript to directly interact with and modify HTML elements, such as showing/hiding the popups and handling animations.
* **JavaScript Event Listeners:** Implementing `scroll` and `click` event listeners to create an interactive user experience.
* **CSS Layouts & Animations:** Using Flexbox for layouts, creating custom animations with `@keyframes`, and applying transitions for smooth visual effects.
* **Responsive Design:** The challenge of writing media queries from scratch to adapt a single codebase to various screen sizes.
